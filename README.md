# GREEN BOX, RED BOX

# this repository contains the data file and associated R-script used in the initial validation of the Green Box, Red Box approach (see King, Billieux & Delfabbro, 2024), to assessing gaming-related harm.

# the the data file (red_box.xlsx) has been de-identified and is available for interrogation
# the red_box.R code is an R script which provides the code used to analyse all results, and generate all figures and tables associated with the manuscript submission to Addiction. 

# to run the results, download the files and save them in the r working directory. You can then run the red_box.R script from your working directory, which will automatically create all assets.
